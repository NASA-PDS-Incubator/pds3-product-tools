    <section name="Installation">
      <p>This section describes how to install the tools contained in the <i>${pom.artifactId}</i> package. The following topics can be found in this section:

    <section name="System Requirements">
      <subsection name="Java Requirement">
        <p>The tools contained in the <i>${pom.artifactId}</i> package were developed using Java and will run on any platform with a supported Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The tools were specifically developed under Sun Java version 1.4, so the tool will execute correctly under versions 1.4 or 1.5.
        </p>

        <p>Since the tools are developed using Sun's Java, this is the preferred Java environment for operation. The Sun Java package can be obtained from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/" target="_blank"> Sun Java</a> web site. Other Java environments are relatively compatible with Sun's Java. Testing has been performed with GNU's Java environment. The result is that release 4.1.1 at a minimum is required for nominal operations.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="Data Dictionary Requirement">
        <p>Release <i>1r64</i> or later of the Planetary Science Data Dictionary (PSDD) is required for the tools to function properly. Release <i>1r66</i> of the PSDD supports the validation of explicit FILE objects. The latest version of the PDS data dictionary can be retrieved from the <a href="http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/data_dictionary_lookup.cfm" target="_blank">PDS Data Dictionary Lookup</a> web page.
        </p>
      </subsection>

    <section name="Unpacking the Tools Package">
      <p>Download the <i>${pom.artifactId}</i> package from the <a href="http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/software_download.cfm" target="_blank">PDS Software Download</a> web page. The binary and source distributions are available in identical zip or tar/gzip packages. Unpack the selected binary distribution file with one of the following commands:
      </p>

      <source>
[node: ~] unzip ${pom.artifactId}-${pom.currentVersion}.zip
or
[node: ~] tar -xzvf ${pom.artifactId}-${pom.currentVersion}.tar.gz
      </source>

      <p>Unpack the selected source distribution file with one of the following commands:
      </p>

      <source>
[node: ~] unzip ${pom.artifactId}-${pom.currentVersion}-src.zip
or
[node: ~] tar -xzvf ${pom.artifactId}-${pom.currentVersion}-src.tar.gz
      </source>

      <p><b>Note:</b> Depending on the platform, the native version of <i>tar</i> may produce an error when attempting to unpack the distribution file because many of the file paths are greater than 100 characters. If available, the GNU version of tar will resolve this problem. If that is not available or cannot be installed, the zipped package will work just fine in a UNIX environment.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Binary Distribution">
        <p>The binary distribution related commands above result in the creation of the <i>${pom.artifactId}-${pom.currentVersion}</i> directory with the following directory structure:
