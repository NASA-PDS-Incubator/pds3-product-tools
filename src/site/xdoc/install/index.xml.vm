    <section name="Installation">
      <p>This section describes how to install the software contained in the <i>${xdoc-artifactId}</i> package. The following topics can be found in this section:

    <section name="System Requirements">
      <p>The following sub-sections detail the system requirements for the tool.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Java Requirement">
        <p>The Product Tools software was developed using Java and will run on any platform with a supported Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The tools were specifically developed under Sun Java version 1.5, so the tool will execute correctly under versions 1.5 or 1.6.
        </p>

        <p>Since the tools are developed using Sun's Java, this is the preferred Java environment for operation. The Sun Java package can be obtained from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/" target="_blank"> Sun Java</a> web site. Other Java environments are relatively compatible with Sun's Java.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      
      <subsection name="Data Dictionary Requirement">
        <p>Release <i>1r64</i> or later of the Planetary Science Data Dictionary (PSDD) is required for the tools to function properly. Release <i>1r66</i> of the PSDD supports the validation of explicit FILE objects. The latest version of the PDS data dictionary can be retrieved from the <a href="http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/dictionary.shtml" target="_blank">PDS Data Dictionary</a> web page.
        </p>
      </subsection>
    </section>

    <section name="Unpacking the Tools Package">
      <p>Download the <i>${xdoc-artifactId}</i> package from the <a href="http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/" target="_blank">Tools &amp; Documentation</a> web page. The binary distribution is available in identical zip or tar/gzip packages. Unpack the selected binary distribution file with one of the following commands:
      </p>

      <source>
[node: ~] unzip ${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}-bin.zip
or
[node: ~] tar -xzvf ${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}-bin.tar.gz
      </source>

      <p>Note: Depending on the platform, the native version of <i>tar</i> may produce an error when attempting to unpack the distribution file because many of the file paths are greater than 100 characters. If available, the GNU version of tar will resolve this problem. If that is not available or cannot be installed, the zipped package will work just fine in a UNIX environment.
      </p>

      <p>The commands above result in the creation of the <i>${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}</i> directory with the following directory structure:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>README.txt</b><br/>
          <p>A README file directing the user to the available documentation for the project.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>LICENSE.txt</b><br/>
          <p>The copyright notice from the <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">California Institute of Technology</a> detailing the restrictions regarding the use and distribution of this software. Although the license is strictly worded, the software has been classified as Technology and Software Publicly Available (TSPA) and is available for <i>anyone</i> to download and use. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>doc/</b><br/>
          <p>This document directory contains a local web site with the Product Tools Guide, javadoc, unit test results and other configuration management related information. Just point your favorite browser to the <i>index.html</i> file in this directory.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>lib/</b><br/>
          <p>This directory contains the dependent jar files for the tool along with the jar file (${xdoc-artifactId}-${xdoc-version}.jar) containing the product tools software.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
