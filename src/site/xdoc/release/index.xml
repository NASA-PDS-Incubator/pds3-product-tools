    <section name="Release 2.0.0">
      <p>This release of the Product Tools software incorporates the Phase II capability supporting validation of catalog files.
      </p>

      <p>The major change for this release is the addition of support for validating catalog files, either standalone or as a set within a CATALOG directory. Modifications to support this capability included a general change with regard to how pointers are handled as well as relaxing some of the PDS Label constraints where catalog files do not conform to those constraints. The result is that catalog files are now validated correctly and the spurious messages that were previously produced have been eliminated.
      </p>

      <p>The other change in this release involved correct validation of quoted date/time strings. Date/time strings may not be quoted when associated with an element that is defined with one of the DATE data types.
