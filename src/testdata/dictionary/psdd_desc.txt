This directory contains two data dictionary files:
lcldd.full
pdsdd.full

lcldd.full is a data dictionary containing some 
local keywords. This was given to me by Ron Joyner
back in 2004, so it is a little old. This data
dictionary was used in generating the lvtool report
file located in testdata/bad_lbl/lcl_label.out.


pdsdd.full is the most recent data dictionary we
have available online.
