This file describes the contents of the good_lbl directory for use with testing the
vtool. 


First off, a good label in this case means a label that produces no errors or
warning messages by the validation tool.


All validation reports have a .out extension and were generated from lvtool
version 2.19. For simplicity, the report files were named after the label
file names so you can easily associate a report with a label.
