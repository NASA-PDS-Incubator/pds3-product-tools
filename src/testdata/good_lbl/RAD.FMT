DESCRIPTION             = "

    The RAD table contains the raw and calibrated observed radiances.
    For each observation there can be up to 6 RAD records, one for each
    active spectrometer detector.  If the Temporal Integration Count
    (OBS Table, TEMPORAL_AVERAGE_COUNT) is greater than 1, then the data
    represent the average of the measurements from that many scans.

    The instrument can apply a programmable spectral mask to the raw
    data causing neighboring channels to be averaged; however, this
    feature is used only when downlink bandwidth is limited.  When
    spectrally masked data are received, the averaged-out channels are
    replaced with the averaged value to expand the spectra back to its
    original size.  The spectral-mask that was used to perform the
    averaging is kept in this table.

    The raw spectra are compressed for downlink.  The original
    bit-packed compression header, containing the size of the
    compressed data and the compression mode used, is kept in this
    table in order to be used to evaluate the performance of the compressor."
