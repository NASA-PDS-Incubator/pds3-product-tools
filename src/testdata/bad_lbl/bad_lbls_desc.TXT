This file describes the contents of the bad_lbl directory for use with testing the
vtool. 


First off, a bad label in this case means a label that produces error and/or
warning messages by the validation tool.


All validation reports have a .out extension and were generated from lvtool
version 2.19. For simplicity, the report files were named after the label
file names so you can easily associate a report with a label.



Now onto a brief description of each of the labels contained in this directory.....



1N131838249THN05A6P1732L0M1.IMG
-------------------------------
An attached label containing an IMAGE object, an IMAGE_HEADER_OBJECT, and several
GROUP objects. This label contains ODL errors because the value stated in line 167
should be in floating-point format instead of integer ("1.0" instead of just "1").
The validation tool also complains about keywords with non-standard values.

There are many "Sequence or set value is not a standard value...." messages in the
report that you can ignore for the time being. We need to push on the standards folks
on this issue. There was talk about possibly adding in more information to the PSDD
in order to properly validate a sequence to the data dictionary.


LCL_LABEL.LBL
-------------
A detached label containing an IMAGE object and a HEADER object. Local keywords are
contained in this label too. This label reports not being able to find a pointer 
to a file. A data dictionary full file containing local keywords (lcldd.full) is
provided in this directory and is used to validate this label only. 


MAG_GAPS_SURVEY.LBL
-------------------
A detached label containing a SPREADSHEET object with FIELD objects. Table data is
in ASCII format. Errors are minor in this label, which consists of keywords with
non-standard values and the SPREADSHEET object missing its FIELDS keyword.


PAN1RED.LBL
-----------
A detached label containing an IMAGE object. This is a PDS2 version label. It
contains an SFDU_LABEL keyword/value at the top of the label file. Warning messages
are produced because of keywords consisting of non-standard keyword values.


SL9PPRG_MOD.LBL
---------------
Detached label containing a TABLE object with 4 COLUMN objects. Several ODL
errors are produced with this label file. FORMAT keywords are not double-quoted.
"Line 18 -- syntax error" message is produced because the line above, doesn't have
a value associated with the keyword. This label is also missing an END statement for
the label itself and an END_OBJECT statement for the TABLE object.
