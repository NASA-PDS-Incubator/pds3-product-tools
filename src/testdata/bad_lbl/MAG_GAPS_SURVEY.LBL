      Brief description of reason for gap. Gaps for which no description is   
      given are typically TELEMETRY OUTAGES, but have not been confirmed.     
                                                                              
      Typical reasons include the following:                                  
                                                                              
      BUFFER OVERFLOW       - the spacecraft Multi-User Buffer (MUB) has      
        filled at a time when there is no downlink                            
      INSTRUMENT ANOMALY    - specifics on instrument anomalies are provided  
        in the instrument catalog file (/CATALOG/GO_MAG_INST.CAT)             
      INSTRUMENT COMMANDING - data corruption due to instrument commanding    
        (includes MAG SENSOR FLIP, and INSTRUMENT MODE CHANGE)                
      NO COVERAGE           - planned gap in data coverage. Examples include  
        intervals when there was no data acquisition scheduled in the         
        sequence, or when ground coverage was released to other spacecraft    
      ONBOARD AACS OUTAGES  - AACS outages onboard the spacecraft cause RTS   
        and optimal averager data (which are processed onboard the spacecraft 
        using the AACS) to become corrupted. AACS outages are frequently      
        related to THRUSTER FLUSHES (see /CATALOG/GO_MAG_SURVEY_DS.CAT)       
      SPACECRAFT SAFING     - specifics spacecraft safings are provided in    
        the instrument catalog file (/CATALOG/GO_MAG_INST.CAT)                
      TELEMETRY OUTAGE      - loss of communication between the spacecraft    
        and ground station. Contributing factors may include ground station   
        malfunction or reallocation, and inclement weather. The reason for a  
        gap may be found in the Science Data Losses files                     
        (/DOCUMENT/PROJECT/AR_SEF/.../*_LOST.TXT)                             
      WRONG ONBOARD MATRIX  - data corrupted because the onboard geometry     
        matrix, offsets, and gains do not match the configuration of the      
        instrument; onboard processing is performed incorrectly"
