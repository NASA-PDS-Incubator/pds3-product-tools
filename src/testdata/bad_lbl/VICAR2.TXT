INTRODUCTION

This file describes the organization and content of the label of the
Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) ground calibration, cruise
and tour formatted images. This label is based on the Video Image
Communication and Retrieval (VICAR) image processing label standard.
Label items, their meaning and values, are described in this document.


VICAR LABEL STRUCTURE

The VICAR label consists of one or more records of ASCII text.  It is
comprised of three groups of descriptive information. Each is detailed
in the three sections below.


SECTION 1: The System Label

The VICAR label is a string of American Standard Code for Information
Interchange (ASCII) characters consisting of free-field items of the
form "keyword = value" separated by spaces.  It contains data set
description system information regarding the dimensions, organization
and data format.  This information is written to the label with the
following keywords:

        LBLSIZE     Size of the label in bytes
        FORMAT      Data format (byte, halfword, real, fullword, etc.)
        TYPE        Data set type (image, parameter, histogram, etc.)
        BUFSIZ      Internal blocksize VICAR will use during input/output
        DIM         Data set dimension
        EOL         End-of-dataset label flag
        RECSIZE     Data set record size
        ORG         Data set organization:
                         BSQ - Band Sequential
                         BIL - Band Interleaved by Line
                         BIP - Band Interleaved by Pixel
        NL          Number of lines or records
        NS          Number of samples or record length
        NB          Number of bands or number of data planes
        NBB         Number of binary prefix bytes
        NLB         Number of binary header records
        N1          Equal to NS
        N2          Equal to NL for BSQ, NB for BIL and NS for BIP
        N3          Equal to NB for BSQ, or NL for BIL and BIP
        N4          Not used
        HOST        Type of computer used to generate the pixel data.
        INTFMT      The format used to represent integers in the file.
        REALFMT     The format used to represent floating numbers.
        BHOST       The type of computer used to generate the binary labels.
        BINTFMT     The integer format used in the binary labels.
        BREALFMT    The floating point format used in the binary labels.
        BLTYPE      The name of the binary label structure.

The values of 'HOST' and 'BHOST' are critical to proper interpretation of
the file.  All 16-bit image data must be byte-swapped if the 'HOST'
listed does not use the same 16-bit data representation as the user's
computer.  The same applies for the 'BHOST' keyword.

Note that the binary label structure changed during the Cruise phase when
the ISS flight software was upgraded from version 1.2 to 1.3.  The value
of BLTYPE indicates which binary label structure applies to the given file.


SECTION 2: Property Labels

All digital images stored in standard VICAR format are preceded by a
property label.  The label consists of image descriptors stored in ASCII.

Flight projects have traditionally designed special label formats to
identify the mission, spacecraft, instrument, target, and frame, and to
include various camera and image geometry information pertinent to the
interpretation of the image.  The property labels are attached to each
image as it is built from telemetry.

For Cassini ISS, the product labels evolved as the mission progressed.
Consequently there are three property label formats:  Ground Calibration,
Cruise, and Tour.  The applicable property label can be identified as
follows:

LABEL TYPE                    Spacecraft Clock range
----------                    ----------------------
Ground Calibration            0 - 1347928992
Cruise                        1347928997 - 1431917801
Tour                          1431917802 - EOM

SECTION 3: History labels

The VICAR label contains processing history information on the file
describing the application programs or procedures which have processed the
data set, the user parameters of the respective programs or procedures, the
user identification and the processing date and time.  These 'history' labels
are added by the VICAR executive after each processing step or may be
explicitly added by a program in order to record program-specific information.

The following VICAR label items are used to describe history information
for each program or procedure executed:

        TASK        Program or procedure that has processed the data set
        USER        User identification
        DAT_TIM     Processing date and time
        opt. items  VICAR label items added by application program or
                    procedure listed under the respective task


APPENDIX: Sample labels

Below are sample labels in the Ground Calibration, Cruise and Tour formats.
Each shows the brief 'system' label, followed by the instrument-specific
'property' labels (beginning with---- Property) and the 'history' label
(beginning with '---- Task').
