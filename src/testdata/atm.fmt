DESCRIPTION                 = "

   The ATM table contains temperature profiles, aerosol opacities, and
   related elements derived from the TES calibrated data.  Derived values
   are based on the average spectra of all six detectors measured while TES
   is operating in the nadir observation mode.  Only data with the following
   quality flags are included for atmospheric evaluation: 
   RAD.QUALITY:MAJOR_PHASE_INVERSION = 0;
   RAD.QUALITY:SPECTROMETER_NOISE = 0-1; 
   RAD.QUALITY:DETECTOR_MASK_PROBLEM = 0.  
   Observations that target a body other than Mars (e.g., Phobos and 
   Deimos), or do not include Mars in the field of view, do not have 
   correlating data in this table.  

   The ATM:QUALITY product contains information on the quality of the
   calculated quantities (see DOCUMENT/QUALITY.TXT for more information).
   Users should also be aware of the following data quality issues:

     Significant problems in temperature retrieval are known to occur over 
     topographic highs, e.g., the Tharsis volcanos.  Over regions of high 
     surface temperature, retrieved atmospheric temperatures in the lowest 
     scale height may be inaccurate.  However, large RMS radiance residuals 
     (TEMPERATURE_PROFILE_RESIDUAL) usually occur in these cases.  

     TES collects data in either of two spectral resolution modes: 'double
     scan' and 'single scan' (see DATA/WAVNUMDS.TAB and DATA/WAVNUMSS.TAB
     for specific wavenumbers).  We have observed that the RMS radiance
     residual values (TEMPERATURE_PROFILE_RESIDUAL) associated with the
     double scan mode temperature profiles are higher than those associated
     with the single scan mode data.  However, there appears to be no bias
     or other distortion present in the two sets of profiles that is 
     outside of the expected temperature uncertainty of ~2K.

     Negative dust and water ice opacity values (NADIR_OPACITY[1:2]) are
     known to exist even for data with a QUALITY:ATM_OPACITY_RATING equal
     to zero.  The estimated uncertainty for any one retrieval of aerosol 
     optical depth is about +/- 0.05. Therefore, we have chosen to include 
     all retrieved NADIR_OPACITY[1:2] values greater than -0.05. A retrieved
     optical depth in the range 0 to -0.05 is consistent with an actual 
     optical depth of zero.  Additionally, we require that the retrieved 
     CO2 optical depth (NADIR_OPACITY[3]) be in the range -0.01 to 0.05 for
     QUALITY:ATM_OPACITY_RATING to be zero. A retrieved CO2 optical depth 
     greater than 0.05 is unphysical and an optical depth in the range 0 to
     -0.01 is consistent with zero. No constraints or quality checks are 
     make for the basalt surface component (NADIR_OPACITY[4]).

     The opacity algorithm fails when the thermal contrast between the
     atmosphere and the ground is too small.  Experience indicates that
     results may be unreliable if the surface temperature drops below about
     220K.  We suggest that opacity users limit their searches to include
     only those values for which the CO2_CONTINUUM_TEMP is greater than 
     220K, and the quality bits QUALITY:TEMPERATURE_PROFILE_RATING and
     QUALITY:ATMOSPHERIC_OPACITY_RATING are both equal to zero.

   Further discussion of the values in this table is available in
   DOCUMENT/PROCESS; questions about the content of the data should be

   Pearl at John.Pearl@gsfc.nasa.gov."
