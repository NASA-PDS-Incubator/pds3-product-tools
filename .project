  <comment>The next generation of Planetary Data System (PDS) Product
		Tools will support design/generation, validation and submission of
		archival products to the PDS. These tools are intended to replace the
		current generation of tools (e.g., lvtool, kwvtool, tbtool, etc.) used
		by the Discpline Nodes, Engineering Node and the PDS user community as
		a whole. This project consists of a library of software classes to
		support the development of the next generation tools.</comment>
