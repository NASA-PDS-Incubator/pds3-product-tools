       <subsection name="Exit Status Values">
         <p>The Validation Tool returns an exit status based on the PDS validation results or if an application failure has occurred. This section details what exit status values to expect when the tool is validating a single data product label and when it is validating multiple data product labels in a single run.

         <p><b>Validation Of A Single Data Product</b></p>
         
         <p>The following table shows what exit values can be returned when the tool validates just one data product label in a single run:

         <table>
           <tr><th nowrap="nowrap">Exit Status Value</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
