        <section name="About PDS Tools">
            <p>The next generation of Planetary Data System (PDS) Tools will support design/generation, validation and submission of archival products to the PDS. These tools are intended to replace the current generation of tools (e.g., lvtool, kwvtool, tbtool, etc.) used by the Discpline Nodes, Engineering Node and the PDS user community as a whole.
            </p>

            <p>The current scope of the task is limited to PDS label and product validation, as directed by the PDS Management Council on October 5, 2005 at the Management Council face-to-face meeting. Other aspects of validation (e.g., catalog, volume and data set validation) will be covered in future phases.
