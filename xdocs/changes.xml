      <action dev="mcayanan" type="add">
        Added the capability to return an appropriate exit status value based on validation results or tool application failure.
      </action>      
      
      <action dev="mcayanan" type="add">
        Created batch and shell scripts for simpler execution of VTool.

    <release version="0.4.0" date="2007-02-01" description="Binary release for the beta test phase.">
      <action dev="pramirez" type="add">
        Added the following capabilities related to semantic validation:
        <ul>
          <li>White space stripping for element value comparison.</li>
          <li>Support for element and object aliases.</li>
          <li>Verifying the existence of referenced data objects and files.</li>
        </ul>
      </action>

      <action dev="pramirez" type="add">
        Implemented reporting including generation of an XML formatted log file which can then be transformed via XSLT stylesheeets into the specified human-readable report formats.
      </action>

      <action dev="mcayanan" type="add">
        Implemented progress reporting, which prints to standard error. This feature will report the directory being validated and then represent each file being validated with an asterisk instead of the actual file name.
      </action>

      <action dev="shardman" type="add">
        Added documentation for Installation and a template for Develoment along with the capability to generate a PDF of the newly named Product Tools Guide.
      </action>

      <action dev="mcayanan" type="update">
        Added and/or modified the following command-line options:
        
        <table>
          <tr><td>-a</td><td>Enable aliasing</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-I</td><td>Specify paths to look for files referenced by pointer statements in a label</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-l</td><td>Specify a file name for the machine-readable log</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-p</td><td>Enable progress reporting</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-r</td><td>Specify a file name for the human-readable report</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-s</td><td>Specify a format for the human-readable report</td></tr>
          <tr><td>-v</td><td>Specify the severity level and above to include in the human-reable report</td></tr>
        </table>
      </action>

      <action dev="mcayanan" type="update">
        Changed the "p" (patterns) flag to an "e" (regexp) flag. Also changed the "l" (local) flag to an "L" flag.
      </action>

      <action dev="mcayanan" type="update">
        Updated VTool to validate files in a directory first before moving on to its sub-directories. Before, validation of files in a directory were interleaved with validation of files in its sub-directories.
      </action>

      <action dev="shardman" type="update">
        Added a <i>Common Errors</i> section to the User Guide as well as clarifying some aspects of setting the <i>CLASSPATH</i> environment variable in the <i>Setup</i> section.
      </action>

      <action dev="pramirez" type="fix">
        Corrected a problem where the tool was not completing syntactic validation on a label.
      </action>

      <action dev="mcayanan" type="fix">
        Fixed to properly handle URLs (for targets, dictionaries, Includes).
      </action>
    </release>
    
    <release version="0.3.0" date="2006-09-12" description="Binary release for the second phase of alpha testing.">
      <action dev="mcayanan" type="add">
        Added a user guide for VTool.
      </action>
      
      <action dev="mcayanan" type="add">
        Added the following command-line options:
          <table>
            <tr><td>-o</td><td>Write the validation results to a file</td></tr>
            <tr><td>-p</td><td>Specify files/file patterns to include in validation</td></tr>
            <tr><td>-X</td><td>Specify files/file patterns to exclude in validation</td></tr>
            <tr><td>-c</td><td>Specify a configuration file to set default behaviors</td></tr>
            <tr><td>-F</td><td>Do not follow STRUCTURE pointers</td></tr>
          </table>
      </action>
      
      <action dev="pramirez" type="add">
        Pointers are now followed. This feature can be turned on and off. This will allow arbitrary length nesting of pointers. Object and group statements should not begin and end in different files. Their contents may be in separate files but the open and close should be contained within the same file. This will allow the label to be valid even when semantic validation is done.
      </action>
      
      <action dev="pramirez" type="add">
        Added support for PDS_VERSION_ID. Now files that don't have this in the first line will be skipped and logged as a warning if passed to the parser.
      </action>
      
      <action dev="pramirez" type="add">
        Added support for SFDUs. Now the SFDUs will be logged and then skipped. This has not added validation of SFDUs.
      </action>
      
      <action dev="mcayanan" type="update">
        Changed the "f" (file) flag to a "t" (target) flag.
      </action> 
      
      <action dev="pramirez" type="update">
        Dates are now checked to ensure that they are not only properly formed but are actual valid dates. One can now get a Date
        object through the API for convenience.
      </action>
      
      <action dev="pramirez" type="update">
        More logging information about file being parsed and dictionaries being used.
      </action>
      
      <action dev="mcayanan" type="fix">
        Fixed multiple dictionary support.
      </action>
      
      <action dev="pramirez" type="fix">
        Properly handle the 'Z' at the end of the date when attempting to create an actual Date object.
      </action>
      
      <action dev="pramirez" type="fix">
        Allow group statements to be within object statements.
      </action>
      
      <action dev="pramirez" type="fix">
        Allow for objects and groups with the same name to appear at the same level within a label or fragment. This required changes to method signatures on the Label class.
      </action>
      
      <action dev="pramirez" type="fix">
        Fixed convenience methods on Label class. This would have only caused a problem if people called the tool directly.
      </action>
      
      <action dev="pramirez" type="fix">
        PSDD will now be adhered to properly as an optional element. This essentially allows any element definition to appear within an object or group statement without generating an error.
      </action>
    </release>

    <release version="0.2.0" date="2006-08-01" description="Binary release for the first phase of alpha testing.">
      <action dev="pramirez" type="update" due-to="Mark Rose" due-to-email="mrose@email.arc.nasa.gov">
        A major overhaul to how the grammar was implemented using Antlr was performed as a result of comments from the Code Walk-through.
      </action>
      <action dev="pramirez" type="add">
        This release supports validation against the PDS Data Dictionary.
      </action>
