            <p>The goal of the Validation Tool is to programmatically ascertain if a given data product is PDS compliant (or "valid"). Typically, this means the data product is well formed, complete, syntactically and semantically correct, and that it conforms to all applicable PDS standards. The standards themselves are defined in the <a href="http://pds.nasa.gov/documents/sr/" target="_blank">PDS Standards Reference</a>.
