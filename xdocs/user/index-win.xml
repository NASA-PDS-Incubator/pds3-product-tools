      <p>For those attempting to run the Validation Tool in a Windows environment, here are the steps for setting the CLASSPATH environment variable via the control panel:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Right-click on My Computer on your desktop and select the Properties menu item.
        </li>
        <li>Navigate to the Advanced tab and select the Environment Variables button. At this point, you should now see a window like the one below:
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Highlight the <i>CLASSPATH</i> variable in the User Variables list and select the Edit button.
        </li>
        <li>Append to the current contents of the variable, the path(s) to the jar files that came with the <i>product-tools</i> package. See the <i>Windows Setup</i> section for actual jar file paths for the current release. Separate each path with a semicolon.
        </li>
        <li>Select the <i>OK</i> button when you are finished editing the <i>CLASSPATH</i> variable, then select the <i>OK</i> button at the Environment Variables window to apply the changes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note: If you already have a DOS window open, you will need to close and re-open the window for the CLASSPATH changes to take effect.
